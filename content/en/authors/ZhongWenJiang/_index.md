My current researches include building predictive frameworks to assess sea-level rise impacts on global terrestrial vertebrates and developing mechanistic models to explore the flying evolution of reptiles. Through conducting physiological and ecological experiments and utilizing numerical models, I am dedicated to addressing crucial issues in the fields of ecology, evolution and conservation biology. My research is question-driven rather than organism-driven, and I enjoy working with a broad range of organism. *Welcome to my website*:[jzhongwen](https://jzhongwen.github.io)
