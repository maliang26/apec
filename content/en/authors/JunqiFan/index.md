<!-- After earning my Bachelor's in Ecology from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2025, I chose to continue my PhD study there. My work is at the intersection of ecological modeling and biodiversity conservation. I apply a range of tools—from physiological and statistical models to geospatial analysis—to tackle sustainability challenges in the human-nature system. My current research focuses on several areas: projecting climate-driven human-wildlife conflicts in China, investigating the phenological mismatch of a protected viper species, and evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in preserving the gibbon's physiological niche.
A deep enjoyment for both urban and natural landscapes is the source of passion for my studies. I see activities like observing nature, traveling, reading, and watching films as essential ways of understanding the world. Additionally, I am a huge fan of rock music and tabletop RPGs. -->
