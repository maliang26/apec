I am interested in understanding human-wildlife interface and addressing its conservation implications in our rapidly changing world. Specifically, my ongoing researches focus on predicting climate-driven conflicts between human and protected mammals in China and evaluating PAs effectiveness using thermophysiology approach for gibbon. I utilize computational and mathematical methods, including species distribution models and mechanistic niche models. Besides enjoying contributing to protect biodiversity, my hobbies include travel, rock bands and TRPG :).
