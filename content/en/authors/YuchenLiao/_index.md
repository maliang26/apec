My primary research interest lies in integrating multiple approaches for biodiversity conservation. I develop spatial methods for species-based approaches and integrate species- and area-based approaches to identify target species in priority areas. I also advance conservation optimization methods that consider future land-use change. My goal is to build a systematic framework to identify conservation gaps, evaluate effectiveness and optimize priority areas to guide future conservation actions.
