My primary research interest is in integrating multiple conservation approaches for biodiversity conservation. I focus on developing spatial methods for species-based strategies to select priority species. I then integrate these species-based methods with area-level approaches, developing a novel strategy by identifying target species in priority areas to guide conservation efforts. In addition, I am committed to developing conservation optimization methods that consider different land-use change scenarios. Ultimately, my goal is to establish a systematic framework that integrates gap identification, effectiveness evaluation, and priority area optimization, providing practical guidance for more effective conservation planning.
