I grew up in Hunan, China, and later embarked on my journey at SYSU, where I have been building a solid foundation in ecology. My academic passion lies in conservation biology and animal physiological ecology, with a specific interest in mammals. As I prepare to pursue advanced studies in this field, I aspire to contribute to biodiversity protection through integrated field investigations and laboratory research.
In addition to scientific research, I stay energized through various sports, while singing and dancing serve as my creative outlets. I believe these experiences not only balance my life but also fuel the creativity and perseverance in scientific research.
I am eager to participate in meaningful research projects and look forward to contributing to the dynamic work of APEC.
