My research interests lie at the intersection of animal science and conservation science. My work aims to investigate how animals are affected by environmental change and human activities, elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms, and explore broader societal implications and conservation policies. Prior to joining Sun Yat-sen University, I assisted in the development of a national reptile database at the Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIB), and contributed to animal ethics research at Kyoto University (KU). I also hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aquaculture from Southwest University (SWU), where I conducted experiments in aquatic biology and participated in comprehensive surveys of fishery resources and environments.
