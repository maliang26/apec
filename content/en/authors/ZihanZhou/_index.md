My research currently focus on the impacts of climate change on desert lizards. My broader research interests lie in climate change ecology and wildlife conservation, with a particular passion for translating abstract research into practical conservation strategies. Through my work, I aim to better understand species’ vulnerabilities to changing environments and contribute to the protection of biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. Outside of academia, I enjoy dancing hip-hop, listening to R&B music, and immersing myself in mystery novels and films, which inspire both creativity and critical thinking.                  
I completed my undergraduate studies at the College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University in Beijing. After joining the APEC Lab as a master’s student, I transitioned into the PhD program, where I continue to pursue my research.
